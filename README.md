Usage
-----

The _uvm_ (unity-version-manager) is a collection of small command-line tools. Each command can be invoked through the main tool `uvm`.

### Version handling

The main purpose of uvm was the management of multiple unity installations on macOS. The idea was to have a similar interface as [rvm] to activate and deactivate different unity installations. This is done by creating a symlink at the default unity installation location (`/Applications/Unity` on macOS).

| command        | description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| use            | Use specific version of unity. |
| clear          | Remove the link so you can install a new version without overwriting. |
| current        | Prints current activated version of unity. |
| list           | List installed unity versions |

### Version installation

These commands allow the installation and deinstallation of Unity versions with additional components.

| command        | description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| install        | Install specified unity version. |
| uninstall      | Uninstall specified unity version |
| versions       | List available Unity versions to install. |

### Miscellaneous commands

| command        | description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| detect         | Find which version of unity was used to generate a project |
| launch         | Launch the current active version of unity. |
| help           | Prints help page for command. |
